# tower-of-Hanoi

Today I want you to work in pairs to build a Towers of Hanoi command line game.
This game will only need one class. Although you can use readline-sync to make things easier, I recommend you push your limits a bit and use the regular readline library that’s already build into Node. https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html .

You’ll need to use createInterface and pass in an input output object.

Learn more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi

Inside of your game constructor it should create a new set of towers and fill the first tower with the appropriate discs, also it should set a moveCount.

Think about some of the functions that you might need. Some that I would recommend are a 
* play
* makeMove
* isValidMove
* render
* getMove
* isWon
 

Those functions should get you most of the way there.

It’s free to sign up and has some helpful resources.

Bonus: make it so they user can decide how many towers to start with and how many discs.
